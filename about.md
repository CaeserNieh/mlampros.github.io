I'm Mouselimis Lampros and I hold a degree in business administration from the university tuebingen, germany. In the last years I participated in many MOOCs (massive open online courses) about machine learning and data science. A detailed list can be found [here](https://github.com/mlampros/mlampros.github.io/blob/master/images/list_moocs_about.md). I do like sports like running, cycling, swimming, tennis playing. From time to time I take part in kaggle competitions to improve my coding skills and to learn about new machine learning methods. My feature plans are to write a phd in machine learning and to work in data science projects.
